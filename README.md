# odin-recipes
Recipes Project made following TOP (The Odin PRoject)

This project contains a simple structure with a few recipes.
The idea was to learn about HTML syntax and how to use them.

I've also used this project to practice my commit messages,
I've started using those commit good practices as well at work and I like it mroe.
